		<span>Go Figure: New Fashion Illustration is the second in a series of exhibitions, which showcases the brightest young talent across the field of fashion. The series will showcase makers who, though not yet widely known, are some of the most outstanding of their generation - whose work takes its place among the best of contemporary practice, while also defining future directions, agendas and tastes around fashion creation.</span>

<span>This exhibition brings together more than sixty works by thirteen international fashion illustrators who execute work in a variety of media, from the digital to the hand-drawn via the physical.  Most of the illustrators bring influences from other disciplines including fashion design, graphic design, photography and film, which provide an insight into a creative field that is truly multi-faceted.</span>
		<p><br /></p>
<span>What binds this group together is the level of attention to detail, craftsmanship and execution, demonstrated through traditional and innovative approaches to materials and process. Work on display has been selected from recent years, both from professional and personal portfolios, to give a sense of each illustrator’s personal creative vision. These works depict menswear and womenswear collections almost equally and provide a glimpse both of London’s creative fashion design talent and more established international names.</span>

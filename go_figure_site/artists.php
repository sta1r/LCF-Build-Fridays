				<span><strong>Richard Kilroy</strong>’s exquisite hand-drawn menswear illustrations demonstrate a keen eye for detail as well a sense of minimalism and space. This London-based illustrator has also publishes his own fashion illustration fanzine called Decoy.</span>

		<span><strong>Artaksiniya</strong> is a Hong Kong-based Russian illustrator, whose unique approach to figure and stance produces arresting results. She also designs textiles and recently set up silk scarf label Square Lust. Through her elaborate use of felt-tips, ball-point pens and three-dimensional layers, she creates a set of distinctive fashionable characters.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span><strong>Tara Dougans</strong>’ painstakingly crafted works have a haunting and deeply personal quality. Her process includes intricately detailed pencil drawings of sartorial minutiae, but also bold paint strokes and digital techniques.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span><strong>Hanna Mueller</strong> is a young Gothenburg-based illustrator who combines ink and aquarelle techniques to create striking portraits that convey a youthfully defiant attitude.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span>Brussels and Atlanta-based Finnish illustrator <strong>Jarno Kettunen</strong>'s live action drawings are created backstage at high fashion shows. He uses line drawing and colours effortlessly; with only a few strokes and blurs of colour he invokes the clothed human form.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span>London-based <strong>Rosie McGuinness</strong>’ croquis-style line drawings intuitively capture the movement of fabric and silhouette.  She has been commissioned to produce work for the Black Dog Publishing, International Textiles Magazine and the Victoria and Albert Museum.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span>Fashion designer and illustrator <strong>Zoya Smirnova</strong>’s ‘straight-up’ drawings of street-style menswear are a distinctive take on individual style.  Zoya also collaborates on a clothing line called ZDDZ, in which her strong graphic sensibilities are featured in casual silhouettes and dynamic prints.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span>Glasgow-based <strong>Lesley Barnes</strong>’ illustrations reveal a keen sense of visual movement, pattern and colour, which point to her background in film and animation. Her pieces often depict the work of young designers through a playful mixture of digital collage and pattern.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span><strong>Cristian Grossi</strong> is an Italian graphic designer and illustrator based in Parma who cleverly contrasts organic patterns and bold colour planes. His 'Insecta' series takes it a step further and the illustrated image literally comes alive through the use of animated gifs.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span>This insinuation of movement through the digital is also demonstrated by Finnish illustrator <strong>Laura Laine</strong>. Her rigorously detailed and delicate hand-drawn illustrations gain a sense of dynamism through her use of posture and styling.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span><strong>Ingela Och Vi</strong> is the Swedish duo of Elisabeth Månsson, an illustrator and graphic designer, and Peter Turkalj, photographer, based in Malmø, Sweden. Together they create what they call ‘illustration photography’, a mixture of set design, fabric swatches and drawing, which are then photographed as final pieces.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span>Madrid-based fashion designer and illustrator <strong>Eugenia Alejos</strong> also uses photography in her work. She playfully refers to her 3D collages as 'organised chaos', combining texture, fabrics and bold brush-strokes to achieve a multi-dimensional effect. Her recent menswear collection, “A dixit”, is a minimalist mosaic of past and the present.</span>
				<p><br /></p>
		<span><strong>Sabine Pieper</strong> is a Berlin-based illustrator and photographer.  Her work plays on different textures  by combining and digitally manipulating scanned fabrics and original line drawings.  Textiles being central to her aesthetic, she has worked extensively with the Dutch textile company Vilsco.</span>
